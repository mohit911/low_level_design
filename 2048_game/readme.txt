take the help of - https://github.com/yangshun/2048-python/blob/master/logic.py

Code not yet complete

What does it do?

It takes input of rows and cols - create a board with each cell as cell onject (row, col, value)
Then it asks for basic initialization (2 positions (row and col))

game starts

can exit any time

enter (L,R, U, D) for the move

So , right now only left movement and right movement are happening

Game status will tell the status -

Up and Down not working - also not merging the values - just movement - need to correct it

NOt entirely written by me - but in bits and pieces

Need to learn the algo - :/
