1. Time (Order Time for an order and Last delivery time for a delivery executive) will always be of type
   datetime and in format - 2018-02-24 03:07:25.654315
2. Positions will be of type tuple and in format (13.006752, 77.561737) where first value represents
   latitude and second one represents longitude
3. For delivery Executives - the delivered_count = random.randint(0, 10) is done for testing purposes. In real life scenario, it will be
   initialized to 0 and will be updated accordingly
4. The run.py and auto_assignment_system.py files are created just to simulate the testing envt and showcase the execution of the code.
5. Assumed all the orders and delivery executives are in the same area for the premium customer strategy. Just considered the delivery
executive with the least number of deliveries yet, but in real we need to filter among only the delivery executives which belong to the
area of the restaurant or which are in range of some specified distance.
